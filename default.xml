      (Commenting this out for now...got answers that build Yocto for 4.4/4.5/4.6
       kernels.  I'm slowly building up to providing 64-bits...unless beaten to it
       I'm going to have to sideline this set...for now....  I'll probably
       delete this section shortly because it's easier to work with Jethro
       anyhow and I don't really need meta-ti unless I'm doing a BBB image...)
